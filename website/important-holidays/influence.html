          <h1>Choral Influence          </h1>
          <h3><span id="Liturgical_function">Liturgical Influence</span></h3>
          <p>In addition to leading of singing in which the congregationparticipates, such as hymns and service music, some church choirs still sing full liturgies, including propers (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the liturgical year). Chief among these are the Anglican andRoman Catholic churches; far more common however is the performance of anthems or motets at designated times in the service.          </p>
          <h3>Social Influence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You discover how to listen carefully.</strong> When singing in a choir, you have to listen so that your voice blends with the voice of the person next to you, as well as with the sounds of the particular type of song you&rsquo;re singing. If the music requires a specific style of singing, you have to work to make sure that you&rsquo;re making the appropriate sound with healthy technique.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You discover how to monitor your sound based on how it feels.</strong> If you can&rsquo;t hear your voice standing out, you have to rely on the feeling to determine whether your technique is still in good shape. Monitoring how your voice feels is a good idea because each room is different — you can&rsquo;t rely on the sound bouncing back to you.</p>
              <p>Sometimes choral singers cup their hand around their ear to hear their voice. You can try using this technique to direct the sound of your voice back to your ears. Just make sure that the person next to you doesn&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;re trying to block out the sound of their voice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You get an opportunity to work on your ear.</strong> Picking out your part when the other voices of the choir are surrounding you is a good workout for your ear. Solo singers may not have someone else singing different notes in their ear.</p>
              <p>The choral singer may be mixed up with other voices singing other parts and may have to rely on her ability to read music or really listen for her note in a chord.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You get a chance to work on your social skills.</strong> In choirs, you often find people who like similar music or are inspired by beautiful music. You may feel right at home around people with similar interests, which can boost your sense of belonging.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You get to travel with the choir.</strong> You may have to raise money to go on trips, but traveling with fellow musicians who enjoy making music in beautiful concert halls can make it worth your while. Teenagers and young singers often enjoy going on the road with the choir because they get to travel around doing what they enjoy: singing with their peers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>You can work on reducing your performance anxiety by singing with a group.</strong> Onstage with your peers, you may find that your anxieties about performing dissolve. If you feel comfortable within a group, you may be able to transfer that comfort level to your solo singing.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Medical Influence          </h3>
          <p>While the feel-good effects of singing have long been recognised, there is growing evidence that it can have a positive impact on a range of physical and psychological conditions, leading to campaigns for singing on prescription.</p>
          <p>In previous studies experts claimed that joining a choir could improve symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s, depression and lung disease.</p>
          <p>Swedish research has suggested that it not only increases oxygen levels in the blood but triggers the release of &ldquo;happy&rdquo; hormones such as oxytocin, which is thought to help lower stress levels and blood pressure.</p>
          <p>A year long study on people with mental health problems, carried out by the Sidney De Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health, Canterbury, has also shown the some 60 per cent of participants had less mental distress when retested a year after joining, with some people no longer fulfilling diagnostic criteria for clinical depression.</p>
          <p>Mr Stewart will present the findings at the annual meeting of the British Psychological Society's Division of Clinical Psychology in York today.</p>
          <p>The fact that the group, made of 197 women and 178 men, found singing in a choir was &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; more effective at improving their mood than a team sport could be down to the synchronicity of the activity, Mr Stewart said.</p>
